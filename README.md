# Final-Assignment

we will implement:

- choose a game by touching pepper in the mentioned spots
    (touch recognition)

- Marco Polo  
    pepper calls Marco  
    you call Polo  
    by deciding on the location of the sounds, pepper will try to find you  
    (speech recognition, sounds localization, movement, speech)  

- Pepper will get a bit frustrated during the Marco Polo game
    it will get more and more red-colored eye-leds  
    once pepper is fully angry and hasn't found you yet, it will cheat in the game  
    and look for your face as well  
    (leds, face recognition)  

- I spy with my little eye
    you mention the color, pepper will need to find the ball in that specific color.  
    this includes both speech and object recognition.  
    (object recognition, speech recognition, movement, speech)
